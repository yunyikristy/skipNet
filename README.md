# Installing Dependencies

1. Install Python 3

3. Install other denpendencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Training

1. Prepare Data

Download Dataset

For Image-Text pair, our model trained on COCO, and can be downloaded from: http://cocodataset.org/#download

For Speech-Text pair, our model trained on MS inner dataset. But it can also be trained by other public dataset, e.g. LibriSpeech
http://www.openslr.org/12

Preprocess the Data

For audio samples, our model trained on mel-spectrogram. 

Write your training list in this format:
'mel-spec-path'|'linear-spec-path'|'lenth'|'text'

2. Train the model 

python3 train.py

# Finetune or Train on Your Own Data

You can set your own appropriate hypapameters in hparams.txt
